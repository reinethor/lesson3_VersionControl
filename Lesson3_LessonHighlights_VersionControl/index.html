            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system to help identify versions of a file through its lifetime. Version control helps solve the problem of saving multiple copies of one file with different names and struggling to remember which file has what information and finding the specific version you need. Or the problem of two people editing the same file. Version control systems allow groups to edit a single file and keep track of who has edited the file and when they edited it; and it saves each version in one repository. The system also allows the user(s) to check the status of the repository not just the version history.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote repository is located on a remote server and it is the origin of where your files are stored. From this remote server multiple people have the opportunity to access these files and store them to their computers to work on them. Commands associated with the remote repository would be ‘git init’ which allows the user to initialize the repository. The next command would be ‘git remote add origin —’ which adds the repository named origin and it also specified what the url would be. You can also use git pull to download the files of the repository to your local repository which I will explain in our next highlight.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local repository is located on the users computer or electronic device. This is where the users will be making a majority of the changes to files and using all of the git commands to access the remote repository. There are two ways to create a local repository. The user can create a whole new repository or they can clone a remote repository onto their local repository. The local repository is great because it is local and you can access the remote repository anywhere with your device you are not restricted by location allowing multiple users from any location to be working on it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is free to use and open source. It is popular for its efficiency and ability to handle small and large projects. Git essentially takes snap shots of your project to track its history and changes the made to the project. It also goes on to track which user is making changes to the project. Git uses easy to learn commands that allow you to access the remote repository from your local device and add it to your local repository. It also helps prevent overwrites for groups when multiple people are editing the same document.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Basic commands for Git include add, commit, and push. Once you have created a remote repository and created a local repository you will use these three commands to edit the files and change the project between both repositories. Git add is when you take all the files that have been changed since the last back up and add them to a stage where they are waiting to be committed to the repository. This is where you would maybe use git status to check and make sure the add went through. Then git commit is used to commit the files to your local repository. From here you will use the command git push to push those files to the remote repository. This will be repeated until your project is complete.</p>
